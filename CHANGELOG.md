# Change Log

All notable changes to the "changes-counter" extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- I didn't think about anything beyond what is being added in 1.0.0. Maybe add support for not only comparison branches but also commits. But let's wait and see if anyone actually uses this extension.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-03-30

### Added

- A status bar item that shows the changes count
- A color change behavior for the status bar item that triggers when the changes quantity exceed the defined changes threshold
- A tooltip to the status bar item that shows more data about the changes, the current comparison branch and the changes threshold as well as links to change both of it
- Warning notifications when the changes quantity exceed the defined changes threshold
